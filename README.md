# Crossplane
## Install Crossplane
```
helm repo add crossplane-stable https://charts.crossplane.io/stable
helm repo update
helm upgrade crossplane --namespace crossplane-system --create-namespace crossplane-stable/crossplane
# Wait for crossplane to be installed before applying other resources
sleep 15
kubectl apply -f provider-aws.yaml
kubectl apply -f functions.yaml
```

## Provider Configuration
The ProviderConfig determines settings the Provider uses communicating to the external provider. Each Provider determines available settings of their ProviderConfig.

Provider authentication is usually configured with a ProviderConfig. For example, to use basic key-pair authentication with Provider AWS a ProviderConfig spec defines the credentials and that the Provider pod should look in the Kubernetes Secrets objects and use the key named aws-creds.

AWS Authentication keys example:

Create `aws-credentials.txt`
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <access_key>
aws_secret_access_key = <secret_key>
```

Create `aws-creds` secret
```
kubectl create secret generic \
aws-creds \
-n crossplane-system \
--from-file=secret-key=./aws-credentials.txt
```

Create providerConfig
```
apiVersion: aws.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: user-keys
spec:
  credentials:
    source: Secret
    secretRef:
      namespace: crossplane-system
      name: aws-creds
      key: secret-key
```

```
apiVersion: s3.aws.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  name: <random_string>-user-bucket
spec:
  forProvider:
    region: us-east-1
  providerConfigRef:
    name: user-keys
```

## AWS Providers

Provider is like install a kubernetes operator for each AWS resource with CRDs

## Managed Resources
https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/managed-resources/

A managed resource (MR) represents an external service in a Provider. When users create a new managed resource, the Provider reacts by creating an external resource inside the Providerâ€™s environment. Every external service managed by Crossplane maps to a managed resource.

- Amazon AWS EC2 Instance defined in provider-upjet-aws.
- Google Cloud GKE Cluster defined in provider-upjet-gcp.
- Microsoft Azure PostgreSQL Database defined in provider-upjet-azure.

## Compositions
https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/compositions/

Compositions are a template for creating multiple managed resources as a single object.

A Composition composes individual managed resources together into a larger, reusable, solution.

An example Composition may combine a virtual machine, storage resources and networking policies. A Composition template links all these individual resources together.

Crossplane calls a Function to determine what resources it should create when you create a composite resource. The Function also tells Crossplane what to do with these resources when you update or delete a composite resource.

When Crossplane calls a Function it sends it the current state of the composite resource. It also sends it the current state of any managed resources the composite resource owns.

If a Composition includes input Crossplane sends it to the function. Input is a useful way to provide extra configuration to a function. Supporting input is optional. Not all functions support input.

### Functions
Installing a Function creates a function pod. Crossplane sends requests to this pod to ask it what resources to create when you create a composite resource.

```
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: function-patch-and-transform
spec:
  package: xpkg.crossplane.io/crossplane-contrib/function-patch-and-transform:v0.8.2
```

# UI
Komoplane from komodorio https://github.com/komodorio/komoplane

Can be installed into k8s. I will run `komoplane` from CLI with the k8s context for this demo

- Download binary from https://github.com/komodorio/komoplane/releases
- extract downloaded `gz`file
- set k8s context
- run binary `./komoplane`
- open browser `localhost:8090`
